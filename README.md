GENDER IDENTIFICATION BY VOICE USING MACHINE LEARNING

Gender Identification is one of the important aspects of speech analysis today.
The gender of the person has become very crucial in economic markets in the form of AdSense and also has many applications.
Identification of gender using the features of acoustic data like mean frequency, median, Q25, IQR, etc. using Machine learning can give good results. 
We used a Kaggle dataset that consists of 3168 recorded voice samples collected from male and female speakers which are pre-processed by acoustic analysis.
Out of these features, we found Mean fundamental frequency, Q25, and IQR play an important role. 
To build a model, we are using different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision tree.
We are using parameters like Precision, F1- score, Recall, and Accuracy to evaluate our algorithms. 
We found the Support Vector machine algorithm performing best in prediction. 
Finally, we took raw voice samples and processed it using the acoustic analysis to extract features in Python and predicted the gender.
